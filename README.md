The war in Ukarine has been at the forefront of global news for the past few months. Many news outlets have claimed that human righst abuses have been occuring in the form of violence against civillians. 

As a result of international news outlets highlighting violence against civilians in the Russian invasion of Ukraine we want to visualise the data gathered by ACLED and see what patterns we could interpret. We are intrigued to see if there was a distinction between the frequency of occurrence and fatality count pre-Russian invasion and post. Also to identify any significant changes since the beginning of the invasion and the progression of the conflict. Finally, we will make a comparison with the rest of Europe and globally to draw a conclusion; is this type of violence an exceptional case? These are the results found in the analysis.

## Data Source 
We downloaded a CSV file from the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) dataset which monitors and records all conflict events around the world.
